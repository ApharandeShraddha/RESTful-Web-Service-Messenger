   A Social Media Application Messenger 

  1  APIS To get messages , Comments , Links and Profile Information.
 
  2. Main purpose of project is to implement RestFul APis and routes Using JAX-RS (Jersey) , So I have not used any database .Instead I          have used manual data and stored that to Map and reutrning values from Map for corresponding REST request.
 
  3. Added Framework For Exception handling by implementing ExceptionMapper of JAX-RS
 
  4. Implemented HATEOAS (To Send Links In Response) Using URIInfo.
 
  5. Content-Negotiation is added to support for both JSON and XML format consumption.
 
  6. Used POSTMAN To test the APIS.
